      <h2>Who is this for ?</h2>
      <p>
        Beginner to Intermediate developers and designers who want to become
        comfortable with both JavaScript fundamentals and working in the DOM
        without a library. You should already know some JavaScript to start -
        This isn't a JavaScript 101 course. If you are new to JavaScript, or
        want to just get comfortable with the fundamentals, I'd recommend you
        take my
        <a href="https://beginnerjavascript.com">BeginnerJavaScript.com</a>
        course use the code JAVASCRIPT30 for an extra $10 off. We learn by
        application - encountering many new situations while talking about the
        hows, the whys and the whats that we use to solve them. We steer clear
        of opinionated design patterns, frameworks, libraries and any type of
        abstraction. These things are great and often needed, but can obstruct
        learning and constrain initial understanding. These tutorials rely
        heavily upon browser APIs, most of which involve interaction with the
        page. If you are stick in <code>console.log()</code> land, these videos
        are your next step. Oh, the stuff we build is really fun!

      <h2>How is this free ?</h2>
      <p>
        These videos are free as a thank-you to everyone who has supported my
        premium courses as well as because I believe in giving back to the
        community. I see a huge need for these videos and I really think it will
        help many of you become comfortable creating with JavaScript While I've
        spent over 300 hours on JavaScript30, enough people find they really
        click with my teaching style and continue their learning with one of my
        premium courses. It all works out!
