                        Developed a driver monitoring system dedicated to ensuring the driver’s safety by detecting driver’s drowsiness state.
                        Utilized the NTHU dataset, which includes videos, and extracted frames from the videos for analysis.
                        Implemented preprocessing techniques to eliminate noise and enhance the quality of the frames.
                        Employed Inception v3, a deep learning model, to process each frame individually.
                        Grouped eight frames together, representing a 10-second time interval, to simulate real-time monitoring.
                        Implemented a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) as the prediction model, taking the set of eight frames as input.
                        Achieved an impressive accuracy rate of approximately 95% in predicting the driver’s sleepiness state
